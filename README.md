# pass_dtmf_digits
This python script will dial a number and pass the DTMF digits to the remote end.

# @jlockett modifications
I took this script and just used the parts necessary to answer a call and return
a single digit. This was specifically to answer guests to my apartment.


# ToDo
1. Dockerize script or just make service
2. Remove unneeded parts
3. Maybe add security code
